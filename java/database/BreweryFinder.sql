He began brewing beer partly out of intrigue, but entirely out of passion. During his college years, his father had turned him on to the hoppy pale ales and IPAs of the West Coast, which eventually led to many months of beer exploration. During this time, he discovered the beautifully dry and expressive farmhouse ales of France and Belgium. After a few months of homebrewing, Jean entered his beer into a local homebrew competition (now one of the nation’s largest), and took first place in the Belgian category with his Saison. Upon obtaining a degree in Special Education (a skill set that has been instrumental throughout his brewing career!) from West Chester University, Jean set off to pursue his passion for beer professionally. He landed a job at Weyerbacher Brewing Company in Easton, Pennsylvania. Through Weyerbacher, Jean learned the ins and outs of brewery management (filtration, bottling, kegging, scrubbing mold, etc.) and made many great friends in the process.  After some time at Weyerbacher, Jean moved on to Iron Hill, where he worked as a brewer at their West Chester location for nearly five years. During this time Jean fell head-over-heels in love with the brewpub model of brewing. By creating beer in one room, and then serving it in another, he was able to connect to the people drinking his beer on a personal level daily; a perk previously unavailable to him while working in a production brewery. After many years of brewing professionally in different environments, much travel, careful consideration, and quite a few business classes from both Wharton and the Community College of Philadelphia, Jean built Tired Hands Brewing Company to be a concise rendition of his ideal brewing environment.',true, 6),

It didn’t even start as Broken Goblet. It started as Brewtal Beer….. The Brewtal Beer Club, in fact. Co-owners Mike Lock and Jay Grosse, while lamenting their jobs and drinking some quality beer, concocted a plan to do something that they enjoyed and maybe even make a living of it. They formulated the brand, invented a very handsome mascot, and approached it from a very different angle – form a club that could grow into a fertile testing ground for ideas, marketing plans and beer testers. With the help of 12 other “founders”, the club was formed and grew from 13-30 in just 6 months, with special events pushing 100+ guests. Out of the group, two brewers stepped forward, similar in vision and equally ready to try something new. And so, Mike and Jay, together with the new brew guys Bub Grosse and Bitter Joe Fazekas, began the very expensive process to bring Brewtal beer from a club to a full-fledged brewery......then came the lawyers.',true, 6),

Back before the internet, armed with my copy of The Joy of Homebrewing and a local homebrew shop, I started creating beers for my friends and myself that would compete with “The Beast”. My early influences were breweries like Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam, as well as local breweries Nodding Head and Dock Street. Being a social brewer I have enjoyed making beers with many different friends over the years, but it was always a hobby. That changed when Brian and I started brewing together in 2009. We decided to take it to the next level, and with input from the many great home brewers from Ale-iens Home Brew Club and The Hulmeville Inn, we refined our beers and debuted them at the Newtown Beer Fest in 2011. The positive response gave us more confidence and we decided to go for it.

	(2, 3, 1, 4, 'Pours a clear brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hint of smoke, raisin, sweet malt, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of raisin, sweet malt, hint of hop. yeast, hint of wheat, hint of roasted malt, and slight spice. Overall, good appearance and feel, but the name implies smoke and it is almost indiscernible. Otherwise a good blend of flavors.'),
	(8, 3, 2, 3, 'Can from the Packie.Lightly hazy lemon in color with a small bubbly white head that slowly recedes. Juicy citrus and topical fruits with bits of earth and grass. Light bready crackery maltiness, bubbly seltzer. Not bad.'),
	(12, 1, 3, 3,'Hazy bronze off white head. Smells of passion fruit and pineapple. This beer is on the sweet side. It does have a bite but the carbonation is low and it doesn''t cut through. I think it is OK.'),
	(16,4, 4, 4,'Hazy bronze off white head. Smells of passion fruit and pineapple. This beer is on the sweet side. It does have a bite but the carbonation is low and it doesn''t cut through. I think it is OK.'),
	(23, 3, 5, 3,'Poured from a pint can into a snifter glass. Full off-white head with an amber colored body of beer. The aroma of citrus and berries were prevalent on the nose. First sip was of grapefruit, apricots and raspberries, with a nice mildly bitter finish provided by the combination of Amarillo and Citra hops. Another fine DIPA from Housatonic.'),
	(27, 5, 6, 4, 'Interesting color and smell. Not typical. Feels like it would be best to drink outdoors. A tad more bitter than I prefer but overall good IPA.'),
	(30, 4, 7, 2, 'Taste: A lot of biscuity malt up front. Balanced out by hops - mostly orange peel and citrus - but not as hoppy as I would expect. Feel: Nice medium body, decent carbonation, and very smooth. Overall: A decent brew, but I had high expectations for such a fresh beer, and it didn''t quite live up to them.'),
	(32, 1, 8, 3, 'Overall considerably Good. Coffee Flavor defiantly comes through in the tasting notes. The beer itself is somewhat bland, more suited towards a larger Market.'),
	(38, 4, 9, 5, 'Amber in color, didn''t seem overcarbonated to me. Powerful aromas of citrus fruit, which was also present in the taste, with some maltiness and a decent bitterness. Fairly light in body but OK. Kind of an unorthodox WCIPA due to the Citra, which brings lots of fruity character.'),
	(39, 5, 10, 5, 'It poured a hazy copper colar with a white head that leaves nice lasing on the glass. It smells and taste of tropical fruit ( mango mostly to me). It has a nice body easy to drink. A good solid IPA to me.'),
	(45, 3, 11, 3, 'Their naming system is confusing. Two versions on the night howler. Vanilla and Coconut version was stellar.'),
	(47, 5, 12, 5, 'Excellent pilsner, well done for this brewer at Dock St. South. Clean clear look and taste with extra hopping appreciated. Really easy to drink and great with pizza!'),
	(52, 4, 13, 4, 'Whirlpooled with Sabro and Mosaic hops after the boil, Tiger Smile is a tropical juice coconut explosion with a slight bit of minty bitterness.  It will put a smile on your face.'),
	(53, 1, 14, 2, 'Love the name wanted to love the beer couldn’t quite get there. Taste is all over the map and kind of boozy. Wish I had more to say but really that is about all for this one'),
	(57, 3, 15, 3, 'Deep orange body. Smells of pine resin and tropical fruit sweetness. Tastes of tropical fruit briefly. Toasty malt with some caramel sweetness. Pine and a resiny bitterness in the back end. Dries out and leaves a long bitter aftertaste. Medium body. Good.'),
	(61, 4, 16, 1, 'Meh, I don''t wanna have to go out to drink it...'),
	(63, 3, 17, 4, 'Cloudy golden with white lacing. Smells of hop spice, light booze, citrus, light rind. Tastes of papaya, citrus, rind, grass, some bitterness. Not crazy thick. Tastes a lot like Money.'),
	(65, 4, 18, 5, 'Phenomenal stuff they''ve created. Absolutely checks all my boxes for an IPA and a clearly different take than many other NEIPAs I enjoy. Super refreshing.'),
	(68, 1, 19, 3, 'Good beer for anyone that is dieting! It is not as good as the regular lager but better than most other light beers I have tried except Yuengling. The taste is fine and the appearace is fine but very pale compared to Yuengling.This beer needs to be very cold for my taste but that is the way I prefer most beers'),
	(71, 5, 20, 5, 'The taste begins with a wave of very pleasing and natural flavors of peanut butter and marshmallows. This carries the taste, throughout. Midway through, the alcohol makes its presence known, with a warm and mellow note. Late in the taste, there is just a faint kiss of herbal hops, balancing out the sweetness. Finishes with a mild, lingering note of marshmallows.'),
	(75, 1, 21, 4, ' First comes dark chocolate followed by roasted malts in the middle where they mix with cacao notes and vanilla turning sweet. The sweetness continues into the rear of the palate mixing with coconut but is slightly blunted by some almond nuttiness and more cacao and dark bitter chocolate.'),
	(78, 3, 22, 2, 'Tart, not excessively sour. Pale slightly hazy pink, moderate head settling quickly to a ring, no lace. Anonymously fruity. Ordinary fruity summer fare.'),
	(80, 4, 23, 1, 'Mild barley and corn that turns to a slight metal twang as a straw, honey and a mix of earth and mossy hops round out the experience. Kind of upset about the middle of the beer, but the rest does make up for it.'),
	(83, 1, 24, 3, 'Was definitely better on tap at the venue than from the can. Less sour more sweet from the can, still good though'),
	(88, 3, 25, 3, 'Somewhere between straw and amber; head subsides quickly with not much retention, clarity is slightly cloudy.'),
	(90, 1, 26, 5, 'An unflitered double IPA, this one is not bitter. Extremely good - a bit more hoppy than most DIPAs this beer has a well balanced flavor profile and is worth drinking.'),
	(93, 5, 27, 4, 'Poured from can into tulip glass. Poured a clear honey blonde with thick fluffy white head. Heavy citrus notes on the nose. Taste followed the nose with a pleasant tart. Medium bodied. Very enjoyable beer. I love sours and I love IPA. They seem to have found the best of both.'),
	(96, 3, 28, 3, 'Sweet, freshly picked Nelson hoppy nose on this one! Ha! Taste follows with a dank, white wine grape, grapefruit bitter bite on the swallow. The depth and feel are decent for a single, but would be better if it was a little softer on the palate. Still an intense Nelson IPA that is really good!'),
	(99, 1, 29, 5, 'Nice summer beer with big LIME flavor'),
	(103, 4, 30, 1, 'Almost tastes like it was originally intended to be a porter, but got infected. Almost no sourness on the nose, but decent sour flavor. Not sure what would improve it but it''s not very good the way it is.'),
	(105, 3, 31, 3, 'Very smooth. Medium body, easy drinking with light carbonation. Finishes dry and doesn''t linger too much on the tongue. A very drinkable beer.'),
	(104, 5, 32, 2, 'Pours near flat, little to no head or lacing, basic and non remarkable hop forward flavour, just ok, def. Not a choice at price point!'),
